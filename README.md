# Card Scanner - User Guide

This tool helps you quickly organize scanned trading cards (Magic, Pokémon, Yu-Gi-Oh) by reading their names using OCR, renaming the images, and saving the results to an Excel file. You can also fetch the latest eBay sale prices for those cards.

---

## 🧰 What You Need
- A folder of scanned card images (JPG or PNG)
- A folder where renamed files and reports will go
- No internet needed until you fetch prices

## 🚀 How to Use It

### 1. **Start the App**
Double-click `CardScanner.exe`. It will open a small window.

### 2. **Pick Your Input and Output Folders**
- Input folder = where your scanned images are
- Output folder = where renamed images and Excel report will go

### 3. **Start the Scan**
Click **"Start Scan"**
- It will ask you to draw a box around where the card name is located
- Use your mouse to click and drag a box on the first card image

## 💰 Fetch eBay Prices

### 1. **Select the Excel File**
Use the “Choose File” button to pick the Excel file you want to look up prices for (most likely one that was just created).

### 2. **Click “Fetch Prices from eBay”**
The tool will:
- Look up each card name on eBay
- Get the most recent sold prices
- Add that price info to the Excel sheet

💡 This step may take a few minutes. You’ll see updates in the box at the bottom while it works.

## 🧼 Tips
- Scans work best when the name is clearly visible (good lighting, no glare)
- You can rescan or retry OCR any time—just make a new folder and scan again
- Always check the Excel sheet afterward to make sure it looks right!

---

## 🕵️ Trouble?
- If the app seems to hang, give it a moment. It might be working.
- If nothing happens when you click, check that you picked valid folders/files

---

## 📁 Output Example
After scanning, your output folder will include:
- Renamed image files
- An Excel sheet like `scan_summary_2025-05-10_14-30-00.xlsx`
- A `logs/` folder with a text file of what was scanned
